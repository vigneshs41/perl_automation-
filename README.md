FUN GAMME

Today, I am getting bored. When I remember my childhood, I recall one friendly game: 'FRAMES.'
'F' => 'Friend',
'R' => 'Relationship',
'A' => 'Affection',
'M' => 'Marriage',
'E' => 'Enemy',
'S' => 'Sister.'

Now I'm trying to play that game with my automation skills. In this game, you give two names as input: a boy's name and a girl's name. I use the boy's name directly, and the girl's name is from a file (remember that all names are generated by ChatGPT).

The algorithm for my code is as follows:

Step 0: Take the girl's name from the file, and the boy's name remains constant.
Step 1: First, remove common letters from both names.
Step 2: After removing them, count the total number of characters from both names.
Step 3: For example, let's say the total character count is "10." Now, count the letters in the 'FRAMES' word letter by letter.
Step 4: When you reach the 10th count, remove that letter from the 'FRAMES' word.
Step 5: Then start counting again from the next letter.
Step 6: Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you reach the last letter from 'FRAMES.'
Step 7: Finally, print the output in the 'output' folder.

Then, based on the letters that remain, you can determine the kind of relationship you and that girl will have. Anyway, it's just a game, haha, just for fun.
